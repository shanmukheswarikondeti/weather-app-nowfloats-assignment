Weather App
The task is to create a weather app that shows the current weather and forecast for a location. The app should allow users to search for locations and save their favorite locations for quick access.
The app should have the following screens:
•	A home screen that displays the current weather for the user's current location and a list of the user's favorite locations.
•	A search screen that allows the user to search for locations by name, city, state, or country.
•	A detail screen that displays the current weather and forecast for a selected location.
•	The app should use the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data.
Requirements:
•	The home screen should show the current weather for the user's current location.
•	The home screen should also show a list of the user's favorite locations. The list should be stored locally on the device and persist across app sessions.
•	The search screen should allow the user to search for locations by name, city, state, or country. The search results should be displayed in a list.
•	The detail screen should show the current weather and forecast for a selected location.
•	The app should use a provider for state management.
•	The app should have unit tests for critical functionality.
